      <h1>About GriotBot</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>GriotBot</strong> is more than just an AI — it is a spark of
        ancestral memory. Designed to honor the rich oral traditions, cultural
        legacy, and lived experiences of the African Diaspora, GriotBot offers
        thoughtful, accurate, and warm guidance.
      </p>

        “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and
        culture is like a tree without roots.” — Marcus Garvey

      <h2>Why GriotBot?</h2>
      <p>
        The griot was the traditional keeper of history, story, and wisdom.
        GriotBot brings that same spirit into the digital age — acting as a
        wise, trusted voice for learners, educators, and community leaders.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone seeking cultural knowledge, inspiration, or connection:
        educators, students, nonprofits, families, and curious minds across the
        globe.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        GriotBot uses advanced language models, guided by a carefully crafted
        prompt that shapes its responses with respect, dignity, and clarity. It
        draws from cultural histories, philosophies, and global Black
        experiences to offer grounded responses — never performative, always
        intentional.
      </p>
